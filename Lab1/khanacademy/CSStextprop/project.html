<p>Greetings to all my new friends on my blog!<br>
  I am very glad to see you all and to know that you follow and support my life.<br>
  In fact, this is my first time creating something like this and so I'm a little embarrassed and scared, but it's all temporary!
  Let's introduce ourselves!<br>
  My name is Nicole and I am 22 years old, I am a hobby artist and a taster for my future job!<br>
  I also love to walk in nature, listen to music, draw, of course, and dance!<br>
  Now let's get to know you!<br>
  Write about yourself in the comments, I will be glad to read.</p>

<p>Hello! As I said earlier in my post, I'm going to become a food taster by trade.<br>
  I dreamed about this job since childhood and dream to this day!<br>
  Is not that great? And what do you think?<br>
  And yet, I have come a long and somewhat difficult path.<br>
  Fortunately, this is already in the past. I've applied for a position at my long-time favorite restaurant and I'm going to accept a positive response!<br>
  I really hope that you are also hoping and rooting for me, because it's so exciting, isn't it?<br>
  In general, I have a lot to do. See you soon!</p>

<h2>I got the job of my dreams!</h2>

<p>Welcome back!<br>
  I'm with good news!<br>
  I was nevertheless accepted for that job in the place that I wanted with all my heart.<br>
  This is really a very significant event for me, because I worked so hard to make it happen. And it happened!<br>
  Despite the reaction and opinion of the people around me and dear to me, I took a step that I would never have dared to take.<br>
  As the saying goes, great deeds require great sacrifices!<br>
  I'm sorry to say this, but unfortunately I'm leaving my vlog because I think I'll reveal all my feelings here, and I may also abandon my work.<br>
  Thanks to everyone who supported me and wrote kind words! I really hope that everything will be wonderful in your life!
  Farewell!</p>
