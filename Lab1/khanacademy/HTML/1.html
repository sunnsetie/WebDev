<h1>Blue fire is fussing about</h1>

<p>Blue fire is fussing about,<br>
    Forgotten far away home<br>
    For the first time I've sang about love,<br>
    For the first time I renounce scandals.<br><br>

    I was like a neglected garden once,<br>
    I was avid towards woman and wine.<br>
    I don't like anymore to drink and to dance<br>
    And wasting my life without looking behind.<br><br>

    I would only keep looking at you,<br>
    To see the whirlpool of your eyes golden-brown<br>
    And that you don't liking the past,<br>
    You couldn't go to another one.<br><br>

    Gentle gait, slender figure,<br>
    If you only knew with stubborn heart,<br>
    How hooligan can love,<br>
    How he can be so humble.<br><br>

    I would forever forgot the restaurants<br>
    I would stop writing the poems.<br>
    If only gently touch your hands<br>
    And your hair that has colour of autumn.<br><br>

    I would forever follow you<br>
    Be it in to my own or foreign distances...<br>
    For the first time I've sang about love,<br>
    For the first time I renounce scandals<br>
