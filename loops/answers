1. What is the last value alerted by this code? Why?
Answer will be 1, because every loop iteration decreases by 1. When i = 0, the loop will stop

2. Which values does the while loop show?
let i = 0;
while (++i < 5) alert( i ); < from 1-4

let i = 0;
while (i++ < 5) alert( i ); < from 1-5

3. Which values get shown by the "for" loop?
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) alert( i );
for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) alert( i );
For both of them answer will be from 0 to 4
